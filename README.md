## Gig Hunter
A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about.
Gig Hunter is a social media website for musicians. It's main goal is to connect musicians to gigs they can play. Any user can post a gig, and the poster of a gig can approve or deny musicians who apply to this gig.

## Motivation
Coming from a background in the music industry, I understand the difficulty of musicians finding gigs to play. It seemed that I would meet musicians who were always looking for gigs to play, and I would meet people who needed musicians to play a gig. This project serves as the middleman between the two parties.
